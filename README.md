# nativescript-moonjs

A starter project for implementing a MoonJS integration with NativeScript.

This is not meant to be used as-is, instead this is a starter boilerplate for someone interested in working on this integration.

This repository will not be maintained, so feel free to copy the contents of it, and work on it in a new repository (forks work too)
